# Technical Data Science Interview Preparation
A personal error log and solution repository for technical interview preparation, with a primary focus on SQL problems.

## About
- **Purpose:** Documenting solutions, debugging processes, and lessons learned during interview preparation
- **Focus Areas:** SQL, Algorithm, Pandas, Statistics, and Machine Learning
- **SQL Engine:** PostgreSQL 14

## Problem Categories
- **sql:** SQL query optimization and problem-solving (primary focus)
- **algorithm:** Algorithm and data structure problems  
- **pandas:** Data preprocessing and manipulation
- **statistics:** Statistical concepts and problem-solving
- **ml:** Machine learning techniques and applied concepts

## Notes
- This repository is designed as a personal study aid and error log
- Each entry includes:
  - The final solution or query/script
  - Debugging steps and problem-solving approaches
  - Key takeaways and optimizations where applicable
- Emphasis is placed on SQL due to its relevance in technical interviews, but other areas are included for comprehensive preparation
