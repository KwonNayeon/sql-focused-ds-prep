## Notes
- This repository is designed as a personal study aid and error log
- Each entry includes:
  - The final solution or query/script
  - Debugging steps and problem-solving approaches
  - Key takeaways and optimizations where applicable
- Emphasis is placed on SQL due to its relevance in technical interviews, but other areas are included for comprehensive preparation
