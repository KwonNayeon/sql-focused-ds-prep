# SQL Practice Repository
Personal repository for SQL problem solving practice and technical interview preparation, primarily focused on data science SQL challenges

## About
This repository contains my solutions and notes for various SQL challenges and interview preparation materials. While SQL is the primary focus, it also includes other technical interview topics for data science positions.

## Current Challenge
**Technical Interview Preparation**
- Primary Focus: SQL problems from StrataScratch
- Additional Areas: Algorithm, Pandas, Statistics, and Machine Learning concepts
- Based on: "Ace the Data Science Interview"

**Completed**
- Advent of SQL 2024-2025: All 25 days solved!
